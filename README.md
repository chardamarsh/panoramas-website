**The Osborne Panoramas** are a collection of 3,093 panoramic images taken from fire lookouts in Oregon and Washington, between 1929 and 1941, using a specially designed camera. At each fire lookout, three pictures each encompassing a 120-degrees of angle were taken. The original 5 x 13 prints, shown here as digital files, are housed at the National Archives and Records Administration in Seattle, WA.

The initial aim of this website is to show replicated work, alongside the original Osborne Panoramas. Ultimately, the site may display all of the quality historic panoramas, whether replicated or not. John Marshall was introduced to the Osborne Panoramas in 2010 by the U.S. Forest Service and the Pacific Northwest Research Station. As of this writing Marshall has replicated over 200 panoramas with funding from a variety of entities, and independently. Conventional tripod-based photography using a DSLR camera and panoramic head is the preferred method for replication. In places where fire towers no longer exist, or trees block the view, unmanned-aerial-systems are deployed. The primary aim is to get an accurate match of the background. Height and position may result in an imperfect match of foreground.

**Technical Notes-** While the image quality seen here is quite good, files have been reduced in size to load rapidly on the web. Historic images were scanned at 600 pixels per inch resulting in an image area 7,700 pixels wide, not including black borders. The native resolution of DSLR panoramas may be over 14,000 pixels wide. On display here are 3,800 pixels wide images.

**About Copyright-** The historic images are all in the public domain. But, public domain does not guarantee publicly accessible files. For Oregon there is easy access to historic Osborne Panoramas through a website owned by The Nature Conservancy. Among the replicated panoramas displayed on this site, some were contracted by state or federal government, and are therefore in the public domain. John Marshall owns copyright to all panoramic replications not generated under government contract.

**Public Display-** This website is designed for personal use, government or academic research, and for display before a live audience such as in a lecture hall. Please seek permission from the authors of this site, before incorporating any display or portion of a display into a separate product or presentation. Permission must also accompany any stand-alone display of this website in a public space.

This site is currently under development. More panorama replication sites will be added as time progresses.

## Using this website

To use this website, simply click on a marker on the map to view site information and the photographs associated with said site. Images can be panned and zoomed using the mouse in both the in-picture and fullscreen views.

In the upper right hand corner of the map, you can select between two layers: Replicated Sites and All Other Sites. Note that some of the sites included in the 'All Other Sites' do have replication images associated with them, but the photos have not formatted for the website yet.

### Current Issues

-If images do not appear on the screen after clicking on a replicated site marker on the map, exit the menu and click on the map marker again. If this does not fix the issue, reload the page.
