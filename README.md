This project was created to display the Osborne Panoramas and their modern-day replications created by John F. Marshall. The Osborne Panoramas are a collection of photos produced by the U.S. Forest Service in the 1930's with the purpose of improving fire suppression information for lookouts and ranger stations. The collection of photos include ~1000 sites located on Forest Service lands in Washington and Oregon.

These historical photos and their modern-day equivalents provide valuable insight into how the natural landscape of these sites has changed throughout the past 80-90 years.

The historical photographs included on this website were scanned by John Marshall from the National Archives in Seattle, WA.

This site is currently under development. More panorama replication sites will be added as time progresses.

## Using this website

To use this website, simply click on a marker on the map to view site information and the photographs associated with said site. Images can be panned and zoomed using the mouse in both the in-picture and fullscreen views.

In the upper right hand corner of the map, you can select between two layers: Replicated Sites and All Other Sites. Note that some of the sites included in the 'All Other Sites' do have replication images associated with them, but the photos have not formatted for the website yet.

### Current Issues

-If an image appears to have moved out of frame after exiting fullscreen mode, use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom out the image. This will reset the image to the correct position.

-If images do not appear on the screen after clicking on a replicated site marker on the map, click the image gallery button in the side menu. If this does not work, exit the menu and click on the map marker again.
